# How to generate and use Gmail App password

If you use [2-Step-Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839) and get
a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an App Password.

1. Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Select **Security**.
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you
   don’t have this option, it might be because:
    - 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
    - 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
    - Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
    - You turned on Advanced Protection.
4. At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose the app you using > **Select device** and
   choose the device you’re using > **Generate**.
5. Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character
   code in the yellow bar on your device.
6. Tap Done.

**Tip**: Most of the time, you’ll only have to enter an App Password once per app or device, so don’t worry about memorizing it.
